Times Table Visualization, CS351L Project 1

Hello! My name is Marina Seheon and this is my Times Table Visualization for Project 1 in CS351L.

Functionality:
I made a program where you can run different times tables visualizations. You can run them randomly, or jump
to a specific one, or choose to go to your favorite visualization.
When you click the start button, the circle will start at a times table number and increment up at a certain speed,
the circle will be in different colors. You can change how fast the circle times table number is incrementing by
the slider labeled as "Increment by" and you can change the speed of how fast the circle moves by the "Delay By(seconds)
slider. You can pause the circle's movement by clicking on the pause button.
You can also jump to a certain parameters of the circle by typing in your times tabel number and number of points in
the text boxes, then click jump and the circle you want to see will apear.
Also, I have included three favorite circles that I like how they look. You click on the drop down menu and pick one,
then the circle you chose will appear.

Possible bugs:
None that I found.
